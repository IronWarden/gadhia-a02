Exercise 12 - Computing Simple Interest
Computing simple interest is a great way to quickly figure out whether an investment has value.
Itâ€™s also a good way to get comfortable with explicitly coding the order of operations in your programs.

Create a program that computes simple interest. Prompt for the principal amount,
the rate as a percentage, and the time, and display the amount accrued (principal + interest).

The formula for simple interest is A = P(1 + rt), where P is the principal amount,
r is the annual rate of interest, t is the number of years the amount is invested,
and A is the amount at the end of the investment.

Example Output
Enter the principal: 1500
Enter the rate of interest: 4.3
Enter the number of years: 4
After 4 years at 4.3%, the investment will be worth $1758.
Constraints
Prompt for the rate as a percentage (like 15, not .15). Divide the input by 100 in your program.
Ensure that fractions of a cent are rounded up to the next penny.
Ensure that the output is formatted as money.
