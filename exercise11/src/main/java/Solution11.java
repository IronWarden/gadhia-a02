Exercise 11 - Currency Conversion
At some point, you might have to deal with currency exchange rates, and youâ€™ll need to ensure your
calculations are as precise as possible.

Write a program that converts currency. Specifically, convert euros to U.S. dollars.
Prompt for the amount of money in euros you have, and prompt for the current exchange rate of the euro.
 Print out the new amount in U.S. dollars.

The formula for currency conversion is derived from c_to / c_from = rate where

c_to is the amount in U.S. dollars.
c_from is the amount in euros.
rate is the per-unit current exchange rate from c_from to c_to.
Example Output
How many euros are you exchanging? 81
What is the exchange rate? 1.3751
81 euros at an exchange rate of 1.3751 is
111.39 U.S. dollars.
Constraints
Ensure that fractions of a cent are rounded up to the next penny.
Use a single output statement.
